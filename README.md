# Capstone Project🎓🥳
## Team name: أُنس الرياض

## Overview 
- This project analyzes eight neighborhoods in Riyadh, selected based on population and geographic location, with two from each region (north, south, east, and west). The objective is to assess how well these neighborhoods meet residents' needs by evaluating seven key factors, such as schools, hospitals and mosques. This aligns with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 Quality of Life Program, which aims to enhance urban living standards. The analysis provides insights into how these neighborhoods support the well-being and quality of life of their residents.
